# ÖVSV SOTA diploma generation

A simple web-service (with accompanying Web UI) to facilitate management, generation and sending of awards for
SOTA accomplishments specific to the Austrian SOTA division.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Configuration options

In order for the application to work properly, a few configuration options need to be passed via environment:
 * QUARKUS_MAILER_HOST
 * QUARKUS_MAILER_USERNAME
 * QUARKUS_MAILER_PASSWORD
 * QUARKUS_MAILER_FROM
 * QUARKUS_MAILER_MOCK=false

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/diploma-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
