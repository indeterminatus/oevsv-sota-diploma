# 4. Use Apache 2.0 License

Date: 2022-11-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Some form of open and permissive license is required for clean distribution and hand-over. Other licenses like
MIT, LGPL, CC would have been equally possible. The decision was arbitrary.

## Decision

The decision fell on Apache 2.0 license, since it allows using and re-distributing the original works, thus encouraging
future improvements.

## Consequences

It should be possible to continue work on the service and any parts, not making me (the original author) necessary for
the process.
