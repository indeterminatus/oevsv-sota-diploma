# 7. Change requirements for S2S

Date: 2022-12-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When the criteria were initially crafted by Martin OE5REO, succeeding in S2S contacts was more difficult than it is
nowadays. The thresholds were raised to those of the other categories.
When the decision was made, nothing was published (yet).

## Decision

The motion was proposed by Martin OE5REO and accepted by Sylvia OE5YYN.

## Consequences

There should be no consequences for the implementation; it is expected that S2S awards are "fair" to achieve and pose
a feasible challenge.
