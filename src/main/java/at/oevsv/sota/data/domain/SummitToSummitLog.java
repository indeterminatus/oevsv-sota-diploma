/**
 * A single log entry of a summit-to-summit event.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that Jackson cannot "virtually" assemble two JSON fields to a single {@link Summit} instance
 * without a big hassle that would produce a lot of boilerplate code. Therefore, properties that begin with an underscore
 * are meant as internal members that should not be used directly. Use the {@link #chasedSummit()} and {@link #activatedSummit()} methods instead!
 * This is not ideal, but since the application is so small and the effects localized, I made a tradeoff in design here.
 * </p>
